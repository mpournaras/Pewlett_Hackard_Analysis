### Pewlett Hackard Challenge!

### Overview:

I was tasked with determining the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. With this analysis I will be able to help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Results:
## The "Silver Wave"

After filtering current employees, we cut down multiple titles over time to each employees current title. These were the title totals:

Figure 1:

Referencing figure 1 we are able to discern a few things:

* There are 72,458 employees at Pewlett Hackard that are set to retire. That is a lot of positions to fill but also an opportunity to reduce costs.
* The vast majority of these are senior level roles. This might sound obvious but it is good to have these numbers backed up by visible data. there are 2.5-3x as many senior level employees as junior level employees in the respective title class.


## To Ment-or Not to Mentor, That is the Question!
Figure 2:

In figure 2 we are able to further discern a couple things. This describes the employees that are set to enter retirement eligibility in a matter of years. These employees are uniquely set to provide mentorship to younger employees. We can see that:

* There are 1549 employees born in 1965.
* Knowing there are 300,000 HP employees, and ~73,000 are set to retire, and ~1600 are able to mentor... we can conclude further that there are 225,000 HP employees that could BE mentored. With a 140 to 1 mentor to potential mentee ratio, this would be a very valuable and competitive resource.

### Summary:
## What do we do?

As mentioned above, there are 72,458 employees set to retire. These are almost all senior level roles. This will be a great opportunity to reduce personnel costs as we lose senior employees to fresher younger ones that are yet to attain those salary levels. 

As mentioned above there are ~1600 qualified, retirement ready employees in the departments ready to mentor the next generation of PH employees. A 140 to 1 ratio of potential mentors to potential mentees does not seem like enough though. This leaves us with a very valuable scarce resource. Perhaps the mentorship could be selected like a scholarship on a merit-based level.
## What else is there?

A potential query we could run is to select the lowest earning, senior level employees to recive the mentorship. These employees could have the ideal balance of experience and room to grow that would be able to draw the most from a valuable scare mentorship.

Another table we could make is a retirement-by-department table. Coupled with our pre-existing employees-by-department table we could discern what departments will get hit hardest by retirements and hire/recruit accordingly. The alternative is to cut positions where there is a far greater ratio of employees to retirements to trim fat and restructure the departments based on need.
